## Latest Build

Note: Yet to be released changes appear here.

## v2.0.0-beta (1-7)
- `Feature`: The description in the headline can be collapsed to give you more modeling space on the canvas. See [User Guide](https://egon.io/howto#headline).

- `Feature`: Auto-save prevents losing a Domain Story because of browser crashes or accidentally closing your browser. See [User Guide](https://egon.io/howto#auto-save-and-creating-new-domain-stories).
- `Feature`: Improved color picker.
- `Feature`: Footer contains version number and link to changelog.
- `Fix`: Sequence numbers are now placed more consistently at the beginning of an activity.
